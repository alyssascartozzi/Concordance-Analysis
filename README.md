# Overview
This analysis was performed to determine if there was concordance between our ancestries-specific GWAS summary statistics. This repository was created by AS on 4/24/2023, with code written by DS. For any questions, please email: alyssa.c.scartozzi@vanderbilt.edu. 

# Concordance Analysis
Concordance analysis compares summary statistics between our ancestries-specific GWAS to determine whether the concordance rate between two summary statistics is greater than expected. The concordance rate is calculated by the proportion of variants that had the same direction of effect over the total variants present in both GWAS. P = .05 was used as our pvalue threshold.
